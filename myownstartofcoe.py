^^^^ all of that is True
____ all of that is True
#B-User are gates: from l.1.2.3 == start.midle.end == unless you press enter you wont go on to the next line.nevel you #
and that is the end of my coding exper.tis if you want more please let me know what do you think
if you wont understand what i was trying to say here well thats on you / if you want me to code it. into something that
    can be visible to GUI well contact me and tell me what would you want me to turn this into
and i will try my best to provide a positive or at least a neutral outcome.
